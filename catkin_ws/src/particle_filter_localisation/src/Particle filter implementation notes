make sure weight is not 0 when calculating weighted average of angles 

particles iunitialised and are generated on the map quite nicely

Problems:
	if the worng assumption of losaction is zoned in through probablity, particles do not re distribute across the map to correct for this
	
	if the particles all leave the map then the map freezes
	

the blue arrow doesnt seem to be following the cloude of particles

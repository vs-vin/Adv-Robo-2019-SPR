Describe what happens when the heuristic cost weight is above 1.0.
Try various start and goal positions, and various weight values.

ANSWER HERE:

As the heuristic cost weight is increased above 1.0, the algorithm is much more 
aggressive in seeking out positions that reduce the Euclidean distance to the goal. 
For lower cost weight values, the algorithm spreads out its search as it seeks the 
path to the goal. 

Changing the heuristic weight value changes the emphasis of the cost versus heuristic 
cost. Higher weight values put greater emphasis on heuristic cost, leading to nodes 
with lower heuristic cost being strongly sought out. Lower weight values put greater 
emphasis on the cost which indicates distance from the start node. Nodes closer to 
the start node are strongly sought out.

Based on the situation, different weight values may be more viable. Open maps with 
few obstacles would benefit from high heuristic cost weight as it would seek out direct 
routes. More maze like maps would benefit from lower heuristic cost weight as it would 
spread out its search through more paths early on rather than railroading the search 
to reduce Euclidean distance.

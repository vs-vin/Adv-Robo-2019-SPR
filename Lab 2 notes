initVal /= 20; // WORKS FINE!!!

initVal = 1/20; // DOES NOT WORK!!!

	1/20 implies integers are being divided and the result wioll be an integer which is 0
	.... so yeah


setup.bash to give full ros functionality (e.g. tab completion)

estimatePose last perhaps
	put things into variables, they get sent through a message

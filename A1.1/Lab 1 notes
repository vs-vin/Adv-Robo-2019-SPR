In the probability equations:
	| is "given that..."
	(see A1.1 Motion probability)
	P (x t+1 = k + 1 |x t = k , u t = 1 ) = 0 .7

learn range for loop in c++

do motion probability (based on equatiojns given)

initialise state

normalise state (simple logic)

update state is worth more

^ means not mormalised probability
